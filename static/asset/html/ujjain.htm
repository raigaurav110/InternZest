            <h2>History</h2><br><br>
            <p>
                Ujjain has a long political history. Protohistoric and early Iron Age material has been found in abundance in the excavations from the Citadel area of Ujjain. According to the Puranas and the Mahabharata, Vrishni-Veer Krishna, and Balarama came here to study at Guru Sandipani's ashram. Mitravrinda, Krishna's wife, was a Ujjain princess. Vind and Anuvind, his two brothers, had achieved heroic speed while fighting on the side of the Kauravas during the Mahabharata battle. In the sixth century AD, Ujjain was ruled by a magnificent ruler named Chand Pradyota. Other Indian rulers used to dread him. Duhita Vasavadatta and Vatsanresh Udayan's love tale is well-known in history; following the Pradyot dynasty, Ujjain became a member of the Magadha Empire.
                <br>
                Emperor Vikramaditya ruled Ujjain; his father was King Gandharvasena; the Shakas were named after a monk named Kalakacharya; the Shakas defeated the ruler of Ujjain, Gandharvasena. They grabbed possession of Ujjain, but the Shakas were defeated by Vikramaditya, the son of King Gandharvasena. Vikramaditya vanquished the Shakas and re-established his predecessors' dominion in Ujjain, earning him the title "Great Emperor of this Country."
                <br>
                Evidence of Ujjayini's historicity was discovered 600 years ago. Avanti district was also one of India's sixteen districts at the time. Avanti was divided into two halves, North and South, with Ujjain as the northern capital and Mahishmati as the southern capital. At the time, the emperor on the throne was Chandrapradyota. Pradyota's family ruled Ujjain until the third century.
